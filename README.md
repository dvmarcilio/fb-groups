# fb-groups

## Known limitations
Since I'm starting from data acquired through [facebook-export](https://www.npmjs.com/package/facebook-export), there are some limitations:
* There are no nested comments (replies as Facebooks call it).
* Comments don't have likes associated with them.
  *   Back in the day it was not a trivial task to retrieve it.
* The photos weren't imported. So no TAGS for now.

* TODO update these limitations
  * not getting data from facebook-export anymore
  * I'm almost sure that we can read photos now too.
  * We can read post mentions.
